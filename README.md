# Crime Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive data analysis on crime data from 2020 to present. It covers data understanding, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development for crime type prediction, and an interactive dashboard for visualization.

## Dataset Description
The dataset `Crime_Data_from_2020_to_Present.csv` contains crime incidents recorded from 2020 onwards. Key features include crime type, location, time, victim demographics, and weapon information.

## Installation Instructions
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage Guide
1.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    Open `crime_data_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook and run all cells sequentially to perform data processing, EDA, and model training.
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # or
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2.  **Run the Dashboard:**
    After running the notebook and generating the necessary processed data and EDA plots, you can launch the interactive dashboard:
    ```bash
    streamlit run dashboard_app.py
    ```

## Results Summary
(This section will be updated with key findings from EDA and model performance metrics after the notebook is fully executed.)

## Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced feature engineering (e.g., geospatial features).
- Explore deep learning models for crime prediction.
- Integrate real-time data streaming for live updates.
- Enhance dashboard interactivity and add more detailed model insights.
- Implement model explainability techniques (SHAP, LIME).
- Create deployment-ready code using Flask/FastAPI.
- Add unit tests for critical functions.
- Include Docker setup for reproducibility.
